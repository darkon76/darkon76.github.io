    "History3": "But I have a problem, I don’t have an assistant that can help me create the definitive soda. wait!",
	"History4": "YOU! You must help me, your face tells me that you understand the division of rational numbers. is not that so?",
	"History5": "ah do not worry it's the simplest, I'll teach you.",

	"INTRO":"**************************************************************************************************************",
	"Intro1": "The integers can be divided, an integer is a complete unit, like a cake, a pencil, a soda.",
    "Intro2": "We are going to divide the soda into two",
    "Intro3": "The soda is equal to 2 parts of 2, 2/2 is equal to 1.",
	"Intro4": "If we take half, there will be ½.",
	"Intro5": "Now we divide that soda for 4 people, in total 4 servings means 4/4, if we take 3 servings, it will be only ¼.",
	"Intro6": "If you want to divide an integer to zero, it is not possible!",

    "TUTO": "*****************************************************************************************",
    "Tuto1": "Now help me fill these sodas according to the division.",
    "Tuto2": "Click on the machine once to fill a fraction, until it is the correct fraction.",

	"Tutorial3": "According to the recipe (-8 / 4 =?) The first soda must contain negative drink (-8), click on the magenta button until it is filled.",
	"Tutorial4": "Well done!",
	"Tutorial5": "The second bottle should be filled with a positive drink (+4), click on the yellow button.",
	"Tutorial6": "Good job!",
	"Tutorial7": "Now according to the laws of signs, the sign of the quotient must be.",
	"Tutorial8": "Negative ÷ Positive is      NEGATIVE!",
	"Tutorial9": "Fill the last bottle with negative drink.",
	"Tutorial10": "Congratulations! The result was a negative relaxing drink!",
	"Tutorial11": "To check The rule for Dividing signed numbers, we take the quotient of the previous division (-2) and multiply it by its divisor (4) and we will obtain the dividend together with its sign.",
