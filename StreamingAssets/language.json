    "History2": "Anyway, my name is Doctor Pepperational Cola Drinkvide. I'm about to discover a fascinating soda unique in the world that will make everyone happy.",
    "History3": "But I have a problem, I don’t have an assistant that can help me to create the definitive soda. Wait!",
	"History4": "YOU! You must help me, your face tells me that you understand the division of rational numbers. am I wrong?",
	"History5": "Ah! don't worry it's very simple, I'll teach you.",

	"INTRO":"**************************************************************************************************************",
	"Intro1": "The integers can be divided, an integer is a complete unit, like a cake, a pencil, a soda.",
    "Intro2": "We are going to divide the soda into two",
    "Intro3": "The soda is equal to 2 parts of 2, (2/2) 2 divided by 2 is equal to 1.",
	"Intro4": "If we take a half, there will be another ½.",
	"Intro5": "Now if we divide that soda for 4 people, we will have 4 servings in total, meaning 4/4, if we take 3 servings, it will be only ¼ left.",
	"Intro6": "If you want to divide an integer by zero, it is not possible!",

	"Tutorial3": "According to the recipe (-8 divided by 4 =?) The first soda must contain negative drink (-8), click on the magenta button until it is filled.",
	"Tutorial4": "Well done!",

	"Tutorial10": "Congratulations! The result was a negative relaxing drink!",
	"Tutorial11": "To check The rule for Dividing signed numbers, we take the quotient of the previous division (-2) and multiply it by its divisor (4) and we will obtain the dividend together with its sign.",
	"Tutorial12": "Fill the first bottle with negative soda.\nFill the second bottle with positive soda.\nAccording to the laws of signs, select the correct soda.",

	"Tutorial19": "Excellent!",
	"Tutorial20": "The second part of the recipe is to multiply the quotient by the divisor.",
	"Tutorial21": "Did you know that the division can be expressed in another way? \nAs we already reviewed in the first recipe: \n15/-3=-5 and we review that -5x-3=15 \nIf we join these two recipes is as follows 15/-3x-5=15 \nThis is another way of expressing the division!",
